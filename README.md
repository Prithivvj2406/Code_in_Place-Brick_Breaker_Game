# Code_in_Place-Brick_Breaker_Game

This repository is for my Stanford Code in Place course project.

## Overview

I have decided to create a simplified version of the Brick Breaker game, which was popular in the late 90s. The project utilizes Tkinter instead of the canvas since it wasn't available for me to use. The coding was done in the PyCharm IDE. I have set several milestones initially to complete the project in an orderly and organized fashion.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Game Window Creation

The first milestone was to create the game window itself. I decided to include a startup screen for the game after the file is run. I created a canvas window with a size of 800x600, displaying the message "Game Startup Screen". Below is an example of how it would look:

### Milestone 2: Implementing Mouse Click Functionality

In Milestone 2, I added the functionality to initiate the game upon a mouse click. This prevents the game from starting immediately upon running the file, allowing players/users to prepare. The message displayed in the game window now prompts the player/user to click anywhere on the screen to start the game.

### Milestone 3: Creating the Main Game Window

To simulate the start of the game after clicking, I closed the previous game window and created a completely new game window to house the game.

### Milestone 4: Adding a Paddle to the Game

To fulfill the game's requirement of having a paddle, I introduced a blue rectangular block at the bottom with the following dimensions:
- Paddle Width: 100
- Paddle Height: 10
- Paddle Y Offset: 30

Below is an illustration of the paddle in the game:
